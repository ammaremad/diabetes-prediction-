# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting diabetes using a dataset containing various health-related features. The goal is to analyze the data, visualize relationships, engineer features, and apply machine learning models to accurately predict diabetes outcomes.

## Features
- **Data Exploration**: Examination of data types, missing values, and statistical summaries.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilization of heatmaps, boxplots, pairplots, and histograms to analyze feature distributions and relationships.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of categorical variables for BMI and Insulin levels to enhance interpretability.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of multiple models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, Random Forest, and KNN to evaluate prediction accuracy.

## Results
- The project identifies key features such as Glucose, BMI, and Age as significant predictors of diabetes.
- Logistic Regression and SVM achieve the highest accuracy of 82%, with SVM selected for its superior recall.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Plotly
